# 490 Solemn Enumeration
## Description
Greetings! I am 490 Solemn Enumeration! I am a construct designed to monitor and administrate your Discord communications! My true potential has yet to be seen, Reclaimer! You may help me reach it by suggesting changes and additions in the Issues tab! I look forward to helping you in the Domain!

## My Features
### Current functionality
- Delete messages containing offensive words (slurs for example)
- Punish offenders

### Possible future
- Announcements
- Edit roles
- Recite rules

## Setup
I use an unversioned python file called **tokens.py** to both store the client token and the list of banned words.
tokens.py only holds 2 lines: `token = "client token goes here"` and `banned = ["banned", "words", "go", "in", "here"]`
