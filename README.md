# 490 Solemn Enumeration
## Description
Greetings! I am 490 Solemn Enumeration! I am a construct designed to monitor and administrate your Discord communications!

## Features
### Current functionality

- Punish offenders

### Possible future

## Setup
This bot uses an unversioned python file called **tokens.py** to both store the client token and the list of banned words.
tokens.py only holds 2 lines: `token = "client token goes here"` and `banned = ["banned", "words", "go", "in", "here"]`
